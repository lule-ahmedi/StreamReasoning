# C-SWRL and StreamJess

- C-SWRL & StreamJess are Stream Reasoning systems, extending C-SPARQL with non-monotonic capabilities. C-SWRL is a unique Semantic Web system for reasoning over stream data, while StreamJess is a Jess system capable of expressive reasoning over stream data.

- Systems are written in Java 1.8. The "ready to go packs" are NetBeans projects.

# Using C-SWRL
To start using C-SWRL the following steps need to be performed:

1. Download and unzip files into your local folder
2. Import the project into your NetBeans
3. Download the InWaterSense ontologies: core, regulations and pollutants
4. Open main\CSWRL.java and replace the InWaterSense ontologies path with your local copies ones
5. Download and import the jar libraries into your project:
C-SPARQL v0.9.6
OWL API v4.0.2
SWRLTab v1.0
SWRL API Drools Engine v1.0 and
JUnit v4.10
6. Run the application

Follow the tutorial to get started with C-SWRL.

# Using StreamJess
To start using StreamJess the following steps need to be performed:

1. Download and unzip the files into your local folder
2. Import the project into your NetBeans
3. Download the InWaterSense ontology Protege project file Link
4. Open main\StreamJess.java and replace the InWaterSense ontology Protege project file path with your local copy of it
5. Download and import the necessary jar libraries into your project:
C-SPARQL v0.9.6
Jess v7.1p2
Jess Tab v1.7 and
Protege v3.5
6. Run the application

Follow the tutorial to get started with StreamJess.
